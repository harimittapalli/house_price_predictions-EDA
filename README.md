# house_price_predictions-EDA

This Jupyter notebook explains about the relationship between the features and 
handling and visualising missing values using `missingno` library.

I have used seaborn to visualize the relationhsip between the features.

Tried to analyze the relationship between output feature which is SalePrice and each numerical feature and categorical fields.

Feel free to update the code.

# house_price_predictions-EDA

This Jupyter notebook explains about the relation ship between the features and 
handling missing values.

I have used seaborn to visualize the relationhsip between the features.

Tried to analyze the relationship between output feature which is SalePrice and each numerical feature and categorical fields.

Feel free to update the code.
